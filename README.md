## Server-side
1. Create tests and download necessary packages 
2. Set up server to connect with local host and create root/routes  
3. Originally planned to use Bootstrap but due to issue with color customisation, decided not to proceed with using Bootstrap as it doesn't seem worth the hassle.
4. Deploy to Heroku

## Client-side

2. Deploy to Netlify
